<p>Hi baby im writing thie letter to aplogize to you look i love you

    and everything in me has become beutiful now you left me my life has 
    started to go backwards you were my path my hope my everythig i dont know

    with all my heart and i never want you to leave i know what we went through was
    difficult but its over why did we end everythig for him?
    iam here iam always want you and i will continue to love you
    from now until my death iam not writntig to you to just comeback 
    iam writing to you so that you know how much i love you and that my
    my intentions are sincer with you is it responable that we go away 
    like this for three years? our journey still long this is the biggest
    dump we had and there might be a bigger one but if we dont know how
    to deal with this one how would we deal with the bigger one? we have loved
    each other we are having fun we are playing we are studying we are joking and 
    if we lose each other far from the evil we will not lost like a lovers
    for me i will have lost a mother a sister a lover a partner in good and bad situation a bestfriend
remember how we were and how we lived and how our things were both beutiful
remember how much we loved each other and beleived in each other remember all
our sweet moments together look at the whole world how it waited for us to leave
lets be stronger lets be for the relationship not against it lets be the same
sweet couple that we were together let me be your refuge and you be my refuge
lets be enough together until the whole world witnesses our loved
i wont take much longer than this but i want to tell you one last thing : i miss you so much
and i miss everything about you from your nagging to your stubbornness to your
grumpiness to your anger i miss every second i spent with you i miss the notification
"good morning" from my melegim i miss everything Shada i dont know if you feel the same
way or not but i will keep telling you that :
